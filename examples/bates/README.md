# Bates numbering with CombinePDF and Rack

This folder holds a demo application combining Iodine's `X-Sendfile` support with the [`combine_pdf` gem](https://github.com/boazsegev/combine_pdf) to create a "bates numbering" tool that is common to the one used by some court systems (such as Israeli courts).
