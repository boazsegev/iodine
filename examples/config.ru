# This is a WebSocket / SSE notification broadcasting application.
#
# Running this application from the command line is easy with:
#
#      iodine
#
# Or, in single thread and single process:
#
#      iodine -t 1 -w 1
#
# Benchmark with `ab` or `wrk` (a 5 seconds benchmark with 2000 concurrent clients):
#
#      ab -c 2000 -t 5 -n 1000000 -k http://127.0.0.1:3000/
#      wrk -c2000 -d5 -t12 http://localhost:3000/
#
# Test websocket echo using the browser. For example:
#      ws = new WebSocket("ws://localhost:3000"); ws.onmessage = function(e) {console.log("Got message!"); console.log(e.data);}; ws.onclose = function(e) {console.log("closed")}; ws.onopen = function(e) {ws.send("hi");};

     if(env['rack.upgrade?'.freeze])
       env['rack.upgrade'.freeze] = BroadcastClient
       return WS_RESPONSE
     end
     # simply return the RESPONSE object, no matter what request was received.
